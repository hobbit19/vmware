Simplify your disaster recovery plans for vSphere with one-pass
ESX / ESXi backup that includes granular restore capabilities across
files, objects and applications.  Improve disaster recovery plans on
site or at a remote site with efficient VMware replication and easier
access during data protection efforts.

Brian Slone said that vRanger Pro was on anc-backups machine:

From inspection with DNS Manager, in Windows 7 Pro SP1 64-bit ajoite virtual
machine under VirtualBox on UAA ITS boothite debian squeeze 6.0.3 workstation:

Run START > Administrative Tools > DNS get prompt for:

Backup & Recovery
=================
o vSphere 5 certified - exploits newly increased 59 streaming VDMK and 1 Terabyte
  memory limits

o One centralized installation provides VMware ESX and ESXi backup across your
  entire vSphere environment

o Native cataloging efficiently indexes file metadata for easy search and
  one-step recovery

o Active Block Mapping reads only active blocks from the image, minimizing backup
  windows and storage needs

o Distributed processing ensures you  avoid impact on host operations by sending
  VM data through a single, central server

o Backup jobs can automatically refresh to stay current with new VMs as they are
  added in the environment


Disaster Recovery
=================
o Virtual Appliance (VA) for ESXi data replication provides flexible and cost
  effective Disaster Recovery (DR) capability

o One centralized installation provides ESX and ESXi replication across your
  entire vSphere environment.  

o Quick, cost-effective recovery can be done on site or at remote sites

o Easy backup of ESX and ESXi VMs to local repositories and replication of ESX
  and ESXi systems  enables off-site recovery.

o Flexibility to combine backup and replication jobs ensures you can meet SLAs
  for recovery time and point objectives


Application Support
===================
o Image-level backups are compatible also with object-level and
  application-specific recovery; for example, you can use Quest's Recovery
  Manager for Exchange with your vRanger backups for agentless, recovery of email
  and other Exchange objects

o Native VSS implementation ensures that applications are properly backed up and
  ready to restore
