<h3><a name="whichhosts">Which hosts are VMware hosts?</a></h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	The host OS is <tt>copacabana.ecn.purdue.edu</tt>
	(the top of two large rack-mount servers).
	</li><li>
	The configuration is stored under <tt>/etc/vmware/</tt>
	</li><li>
	The guests are:<tt><br>
	copavm1.ecn.purdue.edu  128.46.144.211<br>
	copavm2.ecn.purdue.edu  128.46.144.212<br>
	copavm3.ecn.purdue.edu  128.46.144.213<br>

	copavm7.ecn.purdue.edu  128.46.144.217<br>
	copavm8.ecn.purdue.edu  128.46.144.218<br>
	</tt>
	The images of the guest drives are stored under
	<tt>/var/lib/vmware/Virtual\ Machines/</tt>
</li></ul>

<hr>
<h3><a name="installing">Installing VMware</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>
VMware is already installed!
However, as a reference:
</p><ul>
	<li>
	Software is kept in <tt>/etc/vmware/software-archive/</tt>
	</li><li>
	Install the RPM:<br>
	<tt><b># rpm -Uvh VMware-gsx-3.1.0-9089.i386.rpm</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Configure VMware:<br>
	<tt><b># vmware-config.pl</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Extract the tar file:<br>
	<tt><b># cd /tmp</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># tar xvfz VMware-mui-3.1.0-9089.tar.gz</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Configure the web-based administrative interface:<br>
	<tt><b># cd vmware-mui-distrib</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># ./vmware-install.pl</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	That last step should have had you run
	<tt><b>vmware-config-mui.pl</b></tt>
	but if it did not, do so now.
</li></ul>
<p></p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="where">Where are the VMware components on the host OS?</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>
Note that we have GSX Version 3.1 Server, and there are three components:
</p><ul>
	<li>
	<b>VMware</b> itself, what simulates the virtual hardware platforms.
	</li><li>
	<b>vmware-mui,</b> a graphical monitoring and administration
	interface.
	</li><li>
	<b>vmware-console,</b> what lets you attach a virtual console
	to a running virtual machine via the graphical interface.
</li></ul>
<ul>
	<li>
	Configuration files are in <tt><b>/etc/vmware*/</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Virtual machine disk images and individual configuration files
	are in<br>
	<tt><b>/var/lib/vmware/Virtual\ Machines/<em><u>&lt;name&gt;</u></em></b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Helper programs are in <tt><b>/usr/lib/vmware*/</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	The main programs are in <tt><b>/usr/bin/vmware*</b></tt>
</li></ul>

<h3><a name="monitoring">Monitoring VMware virtual machines with</a>
<a name="graphical">the graphical interface</a></h3>
<h3>Note -- not working yet!</h3>
<hr>

<ul>
	<li>
	First, verify on the host OS that the web-based interface
	is listening for you:<br>
	<tt><b># lsof -i tcp:8333</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Start a Mozilla browser (it seems to have some problems with
	Konqueror) and direct it to:<br>
	<tt><b>https://copacabana:8333/</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Authenticate there as <tt>root</tt>
</li></ul>

<hr>
<h3><a name="network">How are the guests configured for networking?</a></h3>
<hr>
<ul>
	<li>
	The guests have publically routable IP addresses resolving to
	ECN hostnames.
	They have full access to the RVL Ethernet via the host's Ethernet.
	</li><li>
	VMware provides the following illusion:

<h3><a name="users">How are the guests configured for user accounts and file systems?</a></h3>
<hr>
<ul>
	<li>
	The guests mount the host's <tt>/home</tt> as their <tt>/home</tt>
	so that a user's environment will be identical across all guests
	and the host.
	</li><li>
	The guests also mount the host's <tt>/usr/local</tt> as their
	<tt>/usr/local,</tt>
	so that any software installed in that area on the guest will
	be available to all guests without duplication of disk storage.
	</li><li>
	I have looked into using LDAPS for remote authentication, so there
	could be a single LDAPS authentication service running on the host OS.
	So far, I have not been successful in setting up an LDAP/LDAPS
	server, OpenLDAP seems to assume a lot of knowledge of X.500.
	Until then, users will need to run <tt>passwd</tt> on all guests
	and the host.

<h3><a name="createnew">How can I create a new virtual machine?</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>
The following is a brute-force method, which takes advantage of
the assumption that an existing machine is the product of a lot
of careful configuration work.
It assumes that two machines have been created, and we are making
the third.
And of course, all this must be done on the host OS!
</p>
<p>
First, clone the filesystem images and do some reconfiguration:
</p>
<ol>

	<li>
	Create a new directory:<br>
	<tt><b># cd /var/lib/vmware/Virtual\ Machines</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># mkdir "Virtual 03"</b></tt>

	</li><li>
	Copy the files over.
	The following scripting trickery changes filename components
	as needed.
	Change the "01" and "03" as needed, and watch the direction
	of those quote marks!<br>
	<tt><b># for F in Virtual\ 01/*</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; do</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; cp -av "$F" "`echo $F | sed 's/Virtual 01/Virtual 03/g'`"</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; done</b></tt><br>
	Be patient, this will take a while...

	</li><li>
	Change the first of two files that specify the disk images:<br>
	<tt><b># cd Virtual\ 03</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># vi Virtual\ 03.vmdk</b></tt><br>
	Globally change "Virtual 01" to "Virtual 03" by typing:<br>
	<tt><b>:%s/Virtual 01/Virtual 03/g</b></tt><br>
	Save your changes and exit the editor.

	</li><li>
	Now edit the other file:<br>
	<tt><b># vi Virtual\ 03.vmx</b></tt><br>
	Globally change "Virtual 01" to "Virtual 03" by typing:<br>
	<tt><b>:%s/Virtual 01/Virtual 03/g</b></tt><br>

	</li><li>
	Delete the write-lock file, if it exists:<br>
	<tt><b># rm Virtual\ 03.vmdk.WRITELOCK</b></tt>

	</li><li>
	Edit the file <tt><b>/etc/vmware/vm-list</b></tt> to add the
	obviously needed line:<br>
	<tt><b>config "/var/lib/vmware/Virtual Machines/Virtual 03/Virtual 03.vmx"</b></tt>

</li></ol>

<p>
Now, bring up the new machine to single-user mode only:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	Go to the console of the host OS.
	If it is not in graphical mode, first login as root and run:<br>
	<tt><b># init 5</b></tt>

	</li><li>
	Login under X using your personal account.

	</li><li>
	Become root:<br>
	<tt><b>$ su</b></tt>

	</li><li>
	Run VMware as root.
	Be patient, it will take several seconds for the graphical interface
	to appear!<br>
	<tt><b># vmware &amp;</b></tt>

	</li><li>
	When you get the "Connect to host" window, make sure that
	the "Local host" button is selected, then click "OK".

	</li><li>
	You will see the virtual machine you just created at the
	end of the list in the inventory in the left-most pane
	(click the "Show/Hide Inventory" button if needed).
	It will have a name that is a duplicate of a name above.
	Right-click that last entry, select "Rename", and give it
	the appropriate name.

	</li><li>
	Click <b>Start this virtual machine,</b>
	and agree to "Create a new identifier".

	</li><li>
	When the VM starts to boot, you must <b><em>quickly</em></b>
	click within the black console window (to get focus inside
	that window), and then be ready to hit the down and up arrow
	keys when the LILO screen appears, so the system does not boot
	in the normal way.

	</li><li>
	Tell LILO to boot into single-user mode:<br>
	<tt><b>linux S</b></tt>

	</li><li>
	It will boot into single-user mode, so you are root on the console.
	You will be editing a couple of files, ignore the warning about
	being unable to write to $HOME.

	</li><li>
	Edit <tt><b>/etc/sysconfig/network</b></tt> and change this line:<br>
	<tt><b>HOSTNAME=<em><u>oldname</u></em>.ecn.purdue.edu</b></tt>

	</li><li>
	Edit <tt><b>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0</b></tt>
	and change this line:<br>
	<tt><b>IPADDR=128.46.144.<em><u>123</u></em></b></tt>

	</li><li>
	Shut it down cleanly with <tt><b>halt</b></tt> so all file system
	changes are flushed to the virtual disk.
	It will be ready for starting from the web-based administrative
	interface.

</li></ol>
<p>
Starting the new machine
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	You should be able to start the new machine with
	<a href="#graphical">the graphical interface, see above</a>
	</li><li>
	Alternatively, careful reading of
	<tt><b>/etc/init.d/vmware</b></tt>
	revealed that if you correctly made the change to
	<tt><b>/etc/vmware/vm-list</b></tt>,
	then the new machine <em>should</em> be started by the
	<tt><b>vmware-serverd</b></tt> daemon.
	Send it a kill signal, forcing it to restart:<br>
	<tt><b># killall vmware-serverd</b></tt><br>
	Have patience, it may take up to three minutes to start
	the process of booting each guest.  You could investigate
	what's running with this:<br>
	<tt><b># ps axuw | grep vmware-vmx</b></tt><br>
	</li><li>
	Finally, here is a <em>really</em> brute-force way of getting a
	virtual machine up and running.
	Again, change the "03" as needed:<br>
	<tt><b># /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware-vmx \</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -C /var/lib/vmware/Virtual\ Machines/Virtual\ 03/Virtual\ 03.vmx -@ "" &amp;</b></tt>
</li></ol>

<hr>
<h3><a name="reboot">What to do after rebooting the host OS?</a></h3>
<hr>

<p>
When Mandrake boots, it re-creates <tt>/boot/kernel.h</tt>,
which normally is a very good thing.
However, it makes VMware believe that it has not yet been configured under
this kernel, even though it is likely the very same kernel that was
running before the last shutdown.
<b><em>This means that the guest machines probably will not come up after a
reboot of the host OS without manual intervention --</em></b>
probably not that big of a deal because the host OS should not need
frequent rebooting.
To work around this issue:
</p><ol>
	<li>
	First verify that no guest machines are running -- if you do see
	the expected set of guest OS processes, do nothing!<br>
	<tt><b># ps axuw | egrep 'PID|vmware-vmx'</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Make sure that the VMware software is really shut down.
	First, stop the VMware services with the boot script:<br>
	<tt><b># /etc/init.d/vmware stop</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	You will likely find that some process survives the shutdown,
	probably <tt>vmware-serverd</tt> -- shut down any surviving
	processing, changing <tt>vmware-serverd</tt> as needed in
	the following:<br>
	<tt><b># ps axuw | egrep 'PID|vmware'</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># pkill -TERM vmware-serverd</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># pkill -KILL vmware-serverd</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Reconfigure VMware for operation under the "new" kernel.
	You should be able to simply agree with all the choices,
	but do make sure that it builds and loads the kernel modules
	as needed:<br>
	<tt><b># vmware-config.pl</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	At this point you should find that VMware has been started,
	but check with the following command and use the boot script
	if needed:<br>
	<tt><b># ps axuw | egrep 'PID|vmware-vmx'</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	The guest machines will come up one at a time, a new one starting
	every three minutes in the reverse of the order they're listed
	in <tt>/etc/vmware/vm-list.</tt>
	While you're waiting, you could type the following at a shell
	prompt to monitor their process:<br>
	<tt><b># while true</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; do</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  clear</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uptime</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  ps axuw | egrep 'PID|vmware-vmx | grep -v grep</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  sleep 10</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; done</b></tt><br>
</li></ol>
<p></p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="ifdead">What to do if the virtual machine processes die?</a></h3>
<hr>

<p>
One alternative is to re-start one machine with the above command.
But that's not really the best way if it's a general die-off....
</p>
<p>
To really shutdown down all of them cleanly and restart, at least
until I get the <tt>vmware-mui</tt> interface running correctly:
</p><ol>
	<li>
	Shut down all the running machines:<br>
	<tt><b># for I in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; do</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; ssh 128.46.144.21${I} halt</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b>&gt; done</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Make sure the VMware daemons are shut down:<br>
	<tt><b># /etc/init.d/vmware stop</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Note that the above will not kill off all the VMware processes,
	I think this is due to differences between the expected
	boot scripts and those found on Mandrake 10.X.
	So make sure:<br>
	<tt><b># pkill -TERM vmware-serverd</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># pkill -KILL vmware-serverd</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># ps axuw | grep vm</b></tt><br>
	You should see nothing here.
	</li><li>
	There may be a bunch of lock files left laying around,
	get rid of them now if needed.
	Be careful with the last two commands!<br>
	<tt><b># cd /var/run/vmware</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># rm %2f*</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># rm serverd-rendezvous</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># rm vmware%2dserverd</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># rm -r root/*</b></tt><br>
	<tt><b># rm -r httpd/*</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	OK, <em>now</em> you should be ready to restart the VMware daemons:<br>
	<tt><b># /etc/init.d/vmware start</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Now you need to be very patient.
	There should be a process <tt><b>vmware-serverd</b></tt>
	which will have read the file <tt><b>/etc/vmware/vm-list</b></tt>
	and will be starting the specified virtual machines.
	However, it will only start one every three minutes, to keep
	from overwhelming the host OS by trying to start all the daemons
	and all the guest operating systems simultaneously.
	Give it about five minutes, and see if any are running:<br>
	<tt><b># ps axuw | grep vmx</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Now wait another three to five minutes and look again:<br>
	<tt><b># ps axuw | grep vmx</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	You should see the virtual machines starting,
	in the reverse of the order that they're listed in
	<tt><b>/etc/vmware/vm-list.</b></tt>
	If so, good, just continue to be patient!
	If not, well, go back to the first step...
</li></ol>

<p>
Another trick for general troubleshooting is to use <tt><b>top</b></tt>
to watch the running virtual machine emulators, the processes running
the command <tt><b>vmware-vmx.</b></tt>
Here's a useful trick:
</p><ol>
	<li>
	Find the list of numeric PID's:<br>
	<tt><b># ps axuw | grep vmware-vmx</b></tt>
	</li><li>
	Now ask for just those PID's, changing the numeric PID's as
	needed in the following:<br>
	<tt><b># top -p 22824,22865,22907,22948,23010,23049,23093,23102</b></tt>
</li></ol>

<hr>
<h3><a name="computeload">How big of a compute load is all of this?</a></h3>
<hr>

<ul>
	<li>
	Not as bad as you might think.
	Each running virtual machine seems to take 5-7% of the available
	CPU cycles when it's mostly idle.
	2-3 times that when it's running <tt>fsck</tt> (at which point
	the processing is probably blocked waiting on I/O).
	</li><li>
	Virtual machines just sitting waiting for a login seem to take
	about 4% of the available RAM.
	</li><li>
	But remember, anything that pegs the CPU on one guest will peg
	the one real CPU.
	All the guests, plus the host OS, must share the RAM and CPU cycles.
	</li><li>
	With eight virtual machines, expect a load average around 10-12!
</li></ul>
