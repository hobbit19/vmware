ESX Server 3.5    - 256GB physical memory and virtual machines with 64GB of RAM.
                    If you have a physical server with more memory than 256GB and would like
                    to have support from VMware, physically remove some RAM so that it
                    is no greater than 256GB.
ESX Server        - Support for up to 32 logical processors
                    64 logical processors are supported experimentally.
ESX Server 3.5    - Dual SAS/SATA controllers.
