VMware Workstation 5.5 What Files Make Up a Virtual Machine?


You may never need to know the file names or locations for your virtual machine files.  Virtual
machine file management is performed by VMware Workstation.  If the behind the scenes file
structure is not interesting to you, skip this section.

A virtual machine typically is stored on the host computer in a set of files, usually in a
directory created by Workstation for that specific virtual machine.

The key files are listed here by extension.  In these examples, <vmname> is the name of your
virtual machine.


Extension:
File Name:
Description:



Extension:   .log
File Name:   <vmname>.log
               or
             vmware.log
Description: This is the file that keeps a log of key VMware Workstation activity.  This file can
             be useful in troubleshooting if you encounter problems.  This file is stored in the
             directory that holds the configuration (.vmx) file of the virtual machine.


Extension:   .nvram
File Name:   <vmname>.nvram
               or
             nvram
Description: This is the file that stores the state of the virtual machine's BIOS.


Extension:   .vmdk
File Name:   <vmname>.vmdk
Description: This is a virtual disk file, which stores the contents of the virtual machine's hard
             disk drive.

             A virtual disk is made up of one or more .vmdk files.  If you have specified that the
             virtual disk should be split into 2GB chunks, the number of .vmdk files depends on
             the size of the virtual disk.  As data is added to a virtual disk, the .vmdk files
             grow in size, to a maximum of 2GB each.  (If you specify that all space should be
             allocated when you create the disk, these files start at the maximum size and do not
             grow.)  Almost all of a .vmdk file's content is the virtual machine's data, with a
             small portion allotted to virtual machine overhead.

             If the virtual machine is connected directly to a physical disk, rather than to a
             virtual disk, the .vmdk file stores information about the partitions the virtual
             machine is allowed to access.

             Earlier VMware products used the extension .dsk for virtual disk files.


Extension:   .vmdk
File Name:   <diskname>-<###>.vmdk
Description: This is a redo-log file, created automatically when a virtual machine has one or
             more snapshots.  This file stores changes made to a virtual disk while the virtual
             machine is running.  There may be more than one such file.  The ### indicates a
             unique suffix added automatically by VMware Workstation to avoid duplicate file
             names.


Extension:   .vmem
File Name:   <uuid>.vmem
Description: The virtual machine's paging file, which backs up the guest main memory on the host
             file system. This file exists only when the virtual machine is running, or if the
             virtual machine has crashed.


Extension:   .vmem
File Name:   <snapshot_name_and_number>
Description: Each snapshot of a virtual machine that is powered on has an associated .vmem file,
             which contains the guest's main memory, saved as part of the snapshot.


Extension:   .vmsd
File Name:   <vmname>.vmsd
Description: This is a centralized file for storing information and metadata about snapshots.


Extension:   .vmsn
File Name:   <vmname>-Snapshot.vmsn
Description: This is the snapshot state file, which stores the running state of a virtual machine
             at the time you take that snapshot


Extension:   .vmsn
File Name:   <vmname>-Snapshot<###>.vmsn
Description: This is the file which stores the state of a snapshot


Extension:   .vmss
File Name:   <vmname>.vmss
Description: This is the suspended state file, which stores the state of a suspended virtual
             machine.

             Some earlier VMware products used the extension .std for suspended state files.

Extension:   .vmtm
File Name:   <vmname>.vmtm
Description: This is the configuration file containing team data.


Extension:   .vmx
File Name:   <vmname>.vmx
Description: This is the primary configuration file, which stores settings chosen in the New
             Virtual Machine Wizard or virtual machine settings editor.  If you created the
             virtual machine under an earlier version of VMware Workstation on a Linux host, this
             file may have a .cfg extension

Extension:   .vmxf
File Name:   <vmname>.vmxf
Description: This is a supplemental configuration file for virtual machines that are in a team.
             Note that the .vmxf file remains if a virtual machine is removed from the team.

             There can be other files in the directory, some of which are present only while a
             virtual machine is running.
