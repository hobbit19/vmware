Working on creating a samba share to share files with Windows XP
under VMware.

package install
===============
Packages to install include samba and smbclient.

dpkg -l | grep samba
ii  samba           3.0.24-6etch9   a LanManager-like file and printer 
                                    server for Unix
ii  samba-common    3.0.24-6etch9   Samba common files used by both the 
                                    server and the client

dpkg -l | grep smb
ii  libsmbclient    3.0.24-6etch9   shared library that allows applications 
                                    to talk to SMB/CIFS serv
ii  smbclient       3.0.24-6etch9   a LanManager-like simple client for Unix
ii  smbfs           3.0.24-6etch9   ount and umount commands for the smbfs 
                                    (for kernels >= than 2.2)
ii  swat            3.0.24-6etch9   Samba Web Administration Tool
                                    Installed to manage shares on 
                                    http://localhost:901/

Create directory to share
=========================
# mkdir /share
# chown -R nobody:nogroup /share/


Configuration
===============
Create SHARE entry in /etc/samba/smb.conf for th e /share
directory.  This provides a mount point for windows XP in
VMware to fetch files.  Installed the SHARE entry with swat 
(Samba Web Administration Tool).  The swat package which 
allows brain dead samba configuration of share via web
browser.  Used swat to create the "SHARE" entry below.

#
# Windows shares for VMWare, added Jan. 4, 2008
#
[SHARE]
        comment = Share for windows files under VMware
        path = /share
        valid users = marcilr
        admin users = marcilr
        write list = marcilr
        hosts allow = 137.229.156.110

Test smb.conf with testparm:
root# testparm -s /etc/samba/smb.conf

Permissions
===========
Setting read/write privs on samba share is a bit tricky.

How do I set permissions to Samba shares?
=========================================
Samba Basic permissions are as follows (configuration file is smb.conf [/etc/samba/smb.conf]):
* read only: This parameter controls whether an user has the ability to create or modify files 
within a share. This is default.
* guest ok: Uf this parameter is set to yes, the users will have access to the share without
  having to enter a password. This can pose security risk.
* writeable: Specifies users should have write access to the share.

You can create the share called helpfiles with read only permission
[helpfiles]
path = /usr/share/docs
read only = Yes

You can create the share called salesdoc with write permission
[salesdoc]
path = /home/shared/sales
writeable = Yes

You can also create a list of users to give write access to the share with write list option. For 
example allow rocky and tony to write to the share called sales:
[salesdoc]
path = /home/shared/sales
write list = rocky tony

You can use following options
* read list: This option accepts a list of usernames or a group as its value. Users will be 
  given read-only access to the share.
* valid users: You can make a share available to specific users. Usernames or group names can 
  be passed on as its value.
* invalid users: Users or groups listed will be denied access to this share.

Samba mask permission
=====================
It is also possible to specify samba default file creation permission using mask.
  * create mask: This option is set using an octal value when setting permissions for files.
  * directory mask: Directories must have the execute bit for proper access. Default parameter 
    is 0755.

[salesdoc]
path = /home/shared/sales
write list = rocky sys
create mask = 0775

Restart samba
=============
root# /etc/init.d/samba restart


Add user password
=================
root# smbpasswd -a marcilr


smb login
=========
~$ smbclient //boothite/marcilr
Password: 
Domain=[BOOTHITE] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.24]
smb: \> 

Accepts 'ls' command to list contents of home directory.

$ smbclient //boothite/share
Password: 
Domain=[BOOTHITE] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.24]
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Thu Jan  3 14:45:35 2008
  ..                                  D        0  Thu Jan  3 14:45:35 2008

                58429 blocks of size 4194304. 40486 blocks available
Also, works for the share.  Cool.


List shares
===========
$ smbclient -L boothite -U marcilr
Password: 
Domain=[BOOTHITE] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.24]

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        share           Disk      Shares for windows XP under VMware
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (boothite server)
        lp              Printer   Generic dot-matrix printer entry

Mount share
==========
To mount the samba share use:

root# mount -t cifs -o user=marcilr,password=*** //boothite/share /mnt


List users
==========
root# pdbedit -w -L       # To get smbpasswd-like output. 


Testing
=======
Test smb.conf with testparm:
root# testparm -s /etc/samba/smb.conf

To strip and optimize smb.conf with:
root#  testparm -s smb.conf.master > smb.conf

To test samba configuration for user marcilr on server boothite
use command:

$ smbclient -L //boothite -U marcilr
Password: 
Domain=[BOOTHITE] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.24]

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        share           Disk      
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (boothite server)
        lp              Printer   Generic dot-matrix printer entry
        marcilr         Disk      Home Directories
Domain=[BOOTHITE] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.24]

        Server               Comment
        ---------            -------

        Workgroup            Master
        ---------            -------

daemons
=======
nmbd - This daemon handles all name registration and resolution requests. 
  It is the primary vehicle involved in network browsing. It handles all 
  UDP-based protocols. The nmbd daemon should be the first command started 
  as part of the Samba startup process. 

smbd - This daemon handles all TCP/IP-based connection services for 
  file- and print-based operations. It also manages local authentication. 
  It should be started immediately following the startup of nmbd.
