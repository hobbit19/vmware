VMware Fusion


VMware Fusion: Powerfully Simple Virtual Machine for Mac

VMware Fusion gives Mac users the power to run Windows on Mac
along with hundreds of other operating systems side by side
with Mac applications, without rebooting.  Fusion is simple
enough for home users and powerful enough for IT professionals,
developers and businesses.


The GCI macBook Pro 2016 running macOS Sierra v10.12.6 (April 23, 2016)
has VMware Fusion 8.5.8 (5824040) installed running Win 7 Pro.
I was also able to install a machine running Debian 9.4.0 amd64.
Very nice.
