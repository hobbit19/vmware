HBA - Host Bus Adapter

IOPS - (Input/Output Operations Per Second, pronounced eye-ops) is a common
  performance measurement used to benchmark computer storage devices like hard
  disk drives (HDD), solid state drives (SSD), and storage area networks (SAN).
  As with any benchmark, IOPS numbers published by storage device
  manufacturers do not guarantee real-world application performance.[1][2]

LUN - In computer storage, a logical unit number or LUN is simply the number
  assigned to a logical unit. A logical unit is a SCSI protocol entity, the
  only one which may be addressed by the actual input/output (I/O) operations.
  Each SCSI target provides one or more logical units, and does not perform
  I/O as itself, but only on behalf of a specific logical unit.

P2V (physical-to-virtual)

VMDK - VMDK files are the actual virtual hard drive for the virtual 
  guest operation system (virtual machine / VM). You can create either dynamic 
  or fixed virtual disks.  With dynamic disks, the disks start small and grow
  as the disk inside the guest OS grows. With fixed disks, the virtual disk and 
  guest OS disk start out at the same (large) disk.

VM - Virtual Machine

VMDK - Virtual Machine Disk is a file format developed by VMware for its
  virtual appliance products, but is now an open format.[1]  The format is a
  container for virtual hard disk drives to be used in virtual machines like
  VMware Workstation or VirtualBox. The maximum VMDK size is generally 2TB for
  most applications, but in September, 2013, VMware vSphere 5.5 introduced
  62TB VMDK capacity.

VMM - In computing, a hypervisor, also called virtual machine manager (VMM), is 
  one of many hardware virtualization techniques allowing multiple operating
  systems, termed guests, to run concurrently on a host computer.  It is so
  named because it is conceptually one level higher than a supervisory program.

VMX - VMware virtual machine configuration.
