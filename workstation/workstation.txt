============================
Downloaded VMware Workstation 15 Pro to check it own for use to
run Debian under Windows 10.

This downloaded:
  VMware-workstation-full-15.0.2-10952284.exe (512MB)

Installed VMware Workstation Pro:
  Ran as Administrator and installed to Windows 10 for testing.
  Skips advanced keyboard package that would have required a reboot.

Got nice VMware Workstion Pro icon on desktop

P.S. Oracle VM VirtualBox is failure badly these days.
