=============================
I like ESXi for the handful of random non-production systems I use.  I just
don't buy that VM is the right direction for every company as a primary
platform.  Sure, small scale VM has it's benefits, but in a large scale
scenario the overhead and vendor lock in becomes short sighted.  Yes,
eventually with enough VM in your datacenter, you'll save money, but at what
long term expense?  What's that vendor proprietary solution going to do for
you in 10 years when you want to move to the next big thing?  I say build out
your DC using commodity hardware and design your applications and network with
fault tolerance and efficiency in mind.  Need a more efficient footprint?  Try
microservers http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/poweredge-c5125/pd [dell.com]

1. Focus on getting the best bang for your buck with commodity hardware
2. Focus your people on streamlining operations for this model (instead of
   focusing on how to integrate VM with existing models, etc) 
3. Design your applications/architecture around not having some magical 
   single box with a thousand mac addresses that can move around the data
   center on a whim.  Who would be dumb enough to believe in this model?
   Google and Facebook, for starters.

=============================
"But Dell, Fujitsu Siemens, HP, IBM, and NEC all ship servers with x86 
virtualization, often VMware's ESX, built in.  A hypervisor talks directly 
to the hardware in lieu of of the operating system.  It lifts the OS up a 
layer and assigns it the task of communicating with the application.  Windows 
used to talk directly to the hardware; in virtualized environments, it just 
hands off requests for hardware services to the hypervisor."

"Dell's lowend $349 netbook runs with consumer-friendly Ubuntu Linux."

Files you should know
=====================
Log files - Log files are just that- a log of virtual server activity for a 
single virtual server. Here is an example of what a log file looks like:

VMware Server & Workstation Disk Files Explained
================================================
When using VMware Server & Workstation, you will, at some point, go to the 
directory where your VMware virtual machines are stored. Inside this directory,
you will see a number of strange files and you will probably wonder what they 
are and what they do. Now, you can stop wondering and find out.

Just Point, Click & Know How Your Virtual Machines Are Performing
=================================================================
When running hundreds to thousands of virtual machines and multiple 
VirtualCenters, it is imperative to deploy a centralized and scalable 
monitoring solution to quickly pinpoint trouble spots and easily track the 
impact of higher hardware utilization and virtual machine performance.

vCharter Pro not only helps users prevent unwanted downtime, it can also 
assist in optimizing resource allocation among virtual machines a major 
consideration for companies deploying large-scale virtualization 
implementations.

us at www.Vizioncore.com!


Files you should know
=====================
Log files - Log files are just that- a log of virtual server activity for a 
single virtual server.  Log files should be used only when you are having 
trouble with a virtual machine.

VMDK files - VMDK files are the actual virtual hard drive for the virtual 
guest operation system (virtual machine / VM). You can create either dynamic 
or fixed virtual disks.  With dynamic disks, the disks start small and grow as
 the disk inside the guest OS grows. With fixed disks, the virtual disk and 
guest OS disk start out at the same (large) disk.  For more information on 
monolithic vs. split disks see this comparison from sanbarrow.com.

VMEM - A VMEM file is a backup of the virtual machine's paging file.  It will 
only appear if the virtual machine is running, or if it has crashed.

VMSN & VMSD files - these files are used for VMware snapshots. A VMSN file is 
used to store the exact state of the virtual machine when the snapshot was 
taken. Using this snapshot, you can then restore your machine to the same 
state as when the snapshot was taken. A VMSD file stores information about 
snapshots (metadata). You'll notice that the names of these files match the 
names of the snapshots.

NVRAM files - these files are the BIOS for the virtual machine. The VM must 
know how many hard drives it has and other common BIOS settings. The NVRAM 
file is where that BIOS information is stored.

VMX files - a VMX file is the primary configuration file for a virtual 
machine. When you create a new virtual machine and answer questions about the 
operating system, disk sizes, and networking, those answers are stored in this
file. As you can see from the screenshot below, a VMX file is actually a 
simple text file that can be edited with Notepad.

  VMWARE NETWORK PORTS Goal: To create a comprehensive list of known 
  ports & protocols used for all VMware communications, in order to configure 
  firewalls to allow specified traffic. 

  V1.0 Current version (First Draft) V1.1 Fill in any blank cells. V1.2 
  Improve descriptions in "Functionality" column. Detailed info - How each 
  port is used. V2.0 Add a column to indicate which VMware software and 
  version # is affected. If this information is available elsewhere, I have 
  not found it, please notify me! Thank you Cameron Rake
