# tools/          VMware Tools is a suite of utilities that enhances the
#                 performance of the virtual machine's guest operating system
#                 and improves management of the virtual machine.  Without
#                 VMware Tools installed in your guest operating system, guest
#                 performance lacks important functionality.
