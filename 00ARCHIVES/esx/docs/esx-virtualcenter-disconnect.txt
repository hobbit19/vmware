Working changing the VM isolation response.


If your gateway is not pingable you can't use its IP address for isolation detection.
You'll have to specify some other IP for this purpose using the HA advanced option 
(das.isolationaddress).

ftcli vmware

This utility allows you to view the active nodes in an HA cluster and the managed IP 
addresses. This utility will help you determine whether the HA agent is in a running 
state and which IP addresses are visible between those managed hosts.

"However Host disconnected from Virtual center and Host not responding are quite different.

NB:The VirtualCenter Server tries to reconnect to a managed host if the connection is lost. 
You can define how long VirtualCenter tries to re-establish the connection. This feature is 
not available When the VI Client is connected directly to an ESX Server. Host not 
responding means Virtual center no longer recieves Heart Beat. This could be because host 
has failed or Virtual center agent has crashed. Host failure detection occurs every 15 
seconds, if there is no response within 12-14 secs window, Host declares itself isolated. 
However during the same interval default isolation response applies on VMs, which is 
shutting down VMs. However if the network is restored in the same window VMs are shutdown 
but not failed over. BUT If the Network is restored before 12 sec, Host is not considered 
as isolated."
