More On VMware ESX Server 3i

Now that the dust has settled a bit around VMware announcing their integrated hypervisor 
VMware ESX Server 3i , more information is starting to leak out. From the start of the 
rumors Dell seemed to be the first big player to come out with a special server just for 
VMware ESX Server 3i. Well it seems the rumor was indeed true. At VMworld, when ESXi was 
announced VMware indeed used a new Dell server specially equipped for (VMware ESX Server 
3i ) virtual workloads. This server is now being called "VESO" and has a pretty nice 
hardware stup: 2 x AMD quad-core Opteron 16 memory slots, 4 PCI slots and four NICs.

At the Direct2Dell.com there is a five minute webcast where David Schmidt shows of the 
new server. Not much to see really but worth a watch anyway. If still crave more 
information, VMware also has published the slidedeck that was used for the VMworld 
session where Vmware ESX Server 3i was introduced. Check that out here.

'There's been a lot of change over at Dell, what with Dell 2.0, and a lot of 
rethinking about what should be in a system," Iams said. "By gaining a foothold 
in the virtualization space," Iams said, Dell could "find a way to break away from 
the pack."

Joe Clabby, president of Clabby Analytics, echoed that assessment. "Dell is not a 
leader in blades," he said. If Dell were able to successfully develop a 
virtualization-specific server, "it gives them a way to get back in and play without 
having to fight" and devote engineering resources to a viable blade platform.

Clabby added that, if true, VESO would represent a bold move for the company. "We 
all know that Dell is a Windows company," Clabby said, "and we're getting to know 
Dell as a Linux company." Embedding VMware on to its servers would present a third 
approach that "wouldn't have any of the bulk of an OS [i.e., Windows], or any of the 
integration problems of Linux, and would let you create these sorts of utility 
servers that you that let you easily build up and tear down applications."

"It's an incredibly obvious direction for the server vendors to go down," said 
Illuminata's Haff. If the Dell VESO rumors are in fact true, Haff said, "and Dell 
does any OK job of it, how could any x86 vendor not go down that 
road?"'
