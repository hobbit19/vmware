VMware ESX server.


VMDirectPath
============
VMDirectPath can be used to allow a VM access to a PCI device.
Only one VM per PCI device though.

"You CAN do direct drive pass-through to specific VMs, but it
requires the motherboard to support  VT-D (for Intel) or IOMMU
(for AMD).  Beyond that I don't think there are any other
requirements for that."
