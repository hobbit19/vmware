Great article on configuring 3ware 9650SE controller as a datastore under ESXi 4.0


3ware 9650se and ESXi 4.0
=========================
December 3rd, 2009

Of course the first thing that I did tonight after receiving my 3ware 9650se 
was to install it in my ESXi 4.0 server and get it going. There are a few 
caveats that I expected and a few that I didn't. Hopefully this post 
will help a few of you out there.

Here are the steps that I performed:
1. Physically installed card and drives.
2. Built the logical unit / volume on the card.
3. Booted ESXi and noticed the card / array not showing up.

I expected #3 from my pre-sales madness research, yeah I'm that bad about 
pre-sales. There is a driver for ESX 4 that enables the hypervisor to be 
installed onto the array. For the rest of us with ESXi 4.0 however, the array
can only be used as a datastore. This isn't an issue anyways since the critical
files are on the array not the single disk or USB device that we install the 
ESXi OS onto.

This led me to 3ware' support site to find the exact article regarding this. 
You can find the article titled "I need support for VMware ESX/ESXi 4.0 and 
ESX/ESXi 4.0 update 1 for 9650SE and 9690SA. Is a certified driver available?"
here. Basically, the top half of the document applies to ESX while the lower 
portion is dedicated to ESXi.

First off, the fact that 3ware has this and other great articles is excellent,
they seem like the "get it". On the other hand I found something difficult to 
do, and not for technical reasons. They instruct you to find the file
"offline-bundle.zip" on the included driver CD.  I searched all over the 
provided driver CD and had no luck locating it; I couldn't help but think that
there ought to have been a download link as well***.  After locating the file
I proceeded down the list of the well written how-to. Unfortunately for me, 
after running the perl vihostupdate.pl -server x.x.x.x -username root 
-password "" -b c:\offline-bundle.zip -i command I received zero feedback 
from the CLI.  I restarted the ESXi server per the documents recommendations 
and upon reboot, no RAID array. Hrmm, I didn't get any errors or feedback. 
After shorting the name of the original file to offline-bundle.zip 
and re-running the command, I did get positive feedback in the form of this \
message: The update completed successfully, but the system needs to be 
rebooted for the changes to be effective. Delicious! Now were are working the 
way we ought to. Restart the ESXi server and enjoy.

*** - Clarification and special note: At the bottom of the page you will see a
download link for a file named: 
vmware-esx-drivers-scsi-3w-9xxx_400.2.26.08.035vm40-1.0.4.00000.179560.iso..  
This ISO image contains the offline-bundle folder. The file that you need for 
the upgrade/upload is named: AMCC_2.26.08.035vm40-offline_bundle-179560.zip. 
The process would not succeed until I renamed 
AMCC_2.26.08.035vm40-offline_bundle-179560.zip to offline-bundle.zip.

Happy virtualizing!

15548, VMware ESX/ESXi 4.0 and ESX/ESXi 4.0 update 1 for 9650SE and 9690SA.
Is a certified driver available?
Some very good info here.  Found when googling for "I need support for VMware ESX/ESXi 4.0 
and ESX/ESXi 4.0 update 1 for 9650SE and 9690SA. Is a certified driver available?"
Original link was gone since LSI bought 3ware.
