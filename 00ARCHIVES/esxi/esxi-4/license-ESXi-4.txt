@fg001 :
Please do not take this as an expert reply - I have very little
knowledge about vmware products.

When you initially apply for the free-esxi download and license
you are able to specify how many physical cpus the instance of
esxi will be running on. The license you are given is tailored
for that physical cpu count. (not the cpu core count)

To install the license, you use the vSphere Client to connect to
your esxi box and add your license (under server configuration
- licensing).  You can run esxi for 60 days without installing
any license - it runs in an evaluation mode.  The evaluation
mode is set by default on installation, it's up to you to install
your license.

If your physical cpu count differs from that in your issued
license, you'll need to get a new license.  The only way I could
find to do that was to completely restart the entire process of 
getting a free esxi download/license (+without+ downloading the
binaries again of course).  By completely restart, I mean
re-register with a new email address and everything - if there's
a  better way +I'd love to know+!  When I restarted the entire
process I specified the new correct physical cpu count and was
sent a new license to install ( installed using vShere Client ).

Yes, esxi can handle multiple physical cpus, but the license must
match that physical cpu count.  Yes, esxi can handle multiple
physical cpus each with multiple cores.  I would be surprised
if you couldn't do 2 x Quadcore or 4 x Dualcore.  I really
couldn't comment on which was better either (other than I'd go
2 x Quad.)

Hope this helps...
