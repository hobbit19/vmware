Using Virtual Ethernet Adapters in Promiscuous Mode on a Linux Host


Fri Feb 10 07:48:08 AKST 2012
=============================
On UAA ITS boothite workstation got error whilst installed ESXi 5.0 to VMware Workstation
7.1.4 machine "The virtual machine's operating system has attempted to enable promiscuous
on adapter Ethernet0.  This is not allowed for security reasons."  Googled up solution
at vmware.com

1. Inspect VMware's vmnetx devices (/dev/vmnet0 if using basic bridged mode):

$ ls -l /dev/vmnet*
crw------- 1 root root 119, 0 Feb  9 15:22 /dev/vmnet0
crw------- 1 root root 119, 1 Feb  9 15:22 /dev/vmnet1
crw------- 1 root root 119, 8 Feb  9 15:22 /dev/vmnet8
$ 

2. Create new vmnet group:

# groupadd vmnet
$ grep vmnet /etc/group
vmnet:x:1011:
$

3. Change ownership of /dev/vmnetx devices to vmnet group:
# chgrp vmnet /dev/vmnet*
# chmod g+rw /dev/vmnet*
# ls -l /dev/vmnet*
crw-rw---- 1 root vmnet 119, 0 Feb  9 15:22 /dev/vmnet0
crw-rw---- 1 root vmnet 119, 1 Feb  9 15:22 /dev/vmnet1
crw-rw---- 1 root vmnet 119, 8 Feb  9 15:22 /dev/vmnet8
#

4. Add marcilr account to vmnet in /etc/group:
vmnet:x:1011:marcilr

5. Logout and login to get vmnet group:
$ id
uid=1000(marcilr) gid=1000(marcilr) groups=1000(marcilr),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),\
40(src),44(video),46(plugdev),50(staff),100(users),109(netdev),110(bluetooth),113(fuse),\
116(scanner),1002(tivo),1003(svn),1004(scans),1010(sshfs),1011(vmnet)

Looks good.


How do I set my virtual Ethernet adapter on my Linux host to run in promiscuous mode? 

Solution
========
VMware software does not allow the virtual Ethernet adapter to go into promiscuous mode unless the
user running the VMware software has permission to make that setting.  This follows the standard 
Linux practice that only root can put a network interface into promiscuous mode.

When you install and configure your VMware software, you run the installation as root, and we 
create the vmnet0-vmnet3 devices with root ownership and root group ownership.  We also give those
devices read/write access for the owner root only.  For a user to be able to set the virtual 
machine's network adapter to promiscuous mode, the user who launches the VMware product needs to 
have read/write access to the vmnetx device (/dev/vmnet0 if using basic bridged mode).

One way to do this is to create a new group, add the appropriate users to the group, and give that
group read/write access to the appropriate device. These changes need to be made on the host 
operating system as root (su). For example:

    chgrp newgroup /dev/vmnet0
    chmod g+rw /dev/vmnet0

    where newgroup is the group that should have the ability to set vmnet0 to promiscuous mode.

If you want all users to be able to set the virtual network adapter (/dev/vmnet0 in our example) 
to promiscuous mode, you can simply run the following command on the host operating system as root:

    chmod a+rw /dev/vmnet0

For more information about issues with promiscuous mode, see Host Crashes at Power on with Bridged
 Networking (514).
 
For Linux systems that use udev, you may see the error as device nodes are recreated at boot time:

    The virtual machines operating system has attempted to enable promiscuous mode on adapter 
    Ethernet0. This is not allowed for security reasons. 

To resolve this error, create the vmnet* devices with the desired ownership and permissions under 
/udev/devices/, rather than creating it under /dev/, as above. .
 
Note: The location depends on the flavor of Linux.
