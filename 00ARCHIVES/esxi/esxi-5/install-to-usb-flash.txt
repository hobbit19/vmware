"The ESXi installer will install directly to a USB flash drive as it did in 4 and 4.1:

# mount -t iso9660 -o loop VMware-VMvisor-Installer-5.0.0-469512.x86_64.iso /mnt




VMware ESXi 5 Scripted Install to USB Flash
August 9, 2011 in Virtualizationism | 1 comment
===============================================
One of the great features of VMware vSphere is the capability to boot VMware ESXi from USB 
flash - eliminating local storage and array controllers can reduce the acquisition and 
operational costs for hypervisor hosts.

Now with VMware ESXi 5, it is possible to perform an automated installation to USB storage.
Simply specify usb-storage as part of the install command in an automated install script.

For example:

  install --firstdisk=usb-storage --overwritevmfs

For more flexibility in a single script, multiple disk types can be specified; they will be 
tried in order.  Below is an example install command from a script for HP servers.  If USB 
flash is not installed, the on-board SAS disks will be used.  If neither are present - such 
as when installing virtual ESXi systems - generic local storage is the last resort.

  install --firstdisk=usb-storage,hpsa,local --overwritevmfs

Perhaps not one of the major new feature of VMware vSphere 5, but handy.
