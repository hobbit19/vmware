VMware vSphere

“Processor” means a single, physical chip that houses a central processing unit that can execute computer programs.

“Server” means a hardware system capable of running the Software.  A hardware partition or blade is considered a separate hardware system.

“vRAM” means the virtual memory configured to a single Virtual Machine.

Additional License Terms                        

You may install and use the Software on a Server that contains up to the maximum number of Processors for which you have paid the applicable license fees. 

Hosting Rights and Restrictions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this EULA, You may use the Software to deliver “internally developed applications” as a service to third parties via an internal or external network.   An “internally developed application” is: (i) a computer application that You have created or developed, and (ii) a third party computer application(s) that (a) is ancillary to your application-based service, and (b) cannot be accessed directly by end users of your application-based service.  Except as expressly provided in this paragraph and Section 2.2 of the EULA, the use of the Software for any other types of hosting or for the benefit of any third-party in any manner is strictly prohibited unless You are an authorized participant in a VMware program that is governed by a separate set of terms and conditions, which authorizes such activity.

vRAM Limitation.  Your vRAM entitlement per Processor is determined by the edition of the Software that You have licensed and the total amount of configured vRAM cannot exceed the available amount of vRAM specified by the Software edition.

Pooling of vRAM.  Subject to Section 2.1 of this EULA, You may aggregate the total amount of vRAM licensed for all vSphere licenses (the “Pool”), as long as those vSphere licenses are: (1) all of the same edition, and (2) all managed by a single instance of vCenter Server or by multiple vCenter Servers operating in linked mode.  The 365-day moving average of “Daily vRAM Usage” cannot exceed the aggregate total licensed vRAM for the vSphere licenses in the Pool (“Moving Average Restriction”). 

“Daily vRAM Usage” means the maximum amount of vRAM configured to all powered-on Virtual Machines in a Pool, in aggregate, that is recorded at any time during a day.  For purposes of calculating Daily vRAM Usage, the amount of vRAM configured to each individual Virtual Machine is deemed to be the lesser of (a) the amount of virtual memory actually configured to such Virtual Machine, or, (b) 96 gigabytes. 

If at any given time when the configured vRAM exceeds the available amount of vRAM, You must purchase additional Software licenses based on the difference between 1) the highest amount of vRAM configured and 2) the available vRAM in order to remain compliant with the vRAM limitation.

vStorage API for Array Integration (VAAI).  You may use storage arrays that are certified for VAAI only with VMware vSphere Enterprise or Enterprise Plus editions.

Third Party Multipathing.  You may use multipathing extensions module only with VMware vSphere Enterprise or Enterprise Plus editions.

vSphere Auto Deploy.  You may use this feature only if You have licensed vSphere Enterprise Plus edition.

vSphere View Accelerator.  You may use this feature only if You have licensed vSphere Enterprise Plus edition.

VMware vSphere Essentials and VMware vSphere Essentials Plus (collectively, the “Essentials Kit”)

In addition to the above license terms, You may install and use vSphere, included in the Essential Kit for up to three (3) Servers, with each Server having up to two (2) Processors. 

Notwithstanding the terms of the Moving Average Restriction set forth above, the amount of vRAM managed by the VMware vCenter Server included with the Essentials Kit cannot exceed 192 GB of vRAM in its Pool at any time.

VMware vSphere Essentials for Retail and Branch Offices and VMware vSphere Essentials Plus for Retail and Branch Offices (collectively, the "ROBO Kit")

In addition to the above license terms, You may install and use vSphere, included in the ROBO Kit for up to three (3) Servers per physical building, with each Server having up to two (2) Processors. The number of physical buildings with Servers may not exceed the number of ROBO Kit licenses purchased. 

Notwithstanding the terms of the Moving Average Restriction set forth above, the amount of vRAM managed by the VMware vCenter Server included with the ROBO Kit cannot exceed 192 GB of vRAM in its Pool at any time.

VMware vSphere Hypervisor

You may only install and use vSphere Hypervisor on a Server that has up to 32GB of physical RAM and the vRAM entitlement for each Server is limited to 32 gigabytes.

VMware vSphere Desktop

You may only install and use vSphere Desktop to host (i) a virtual desktop infrastructure for up to the number of Desktop Virtual Machines (as defined below in VMware View) for which You have paid the applicable license fees, and (ii) associated desktop management and monitoring tools.  vSphere Desktop is not subject to a vRAM limitation.

VMware View 

"Desktop Virtual Machine" is a hosted Virtual Machine with one of the following Windows operating systems: XP, Vista, and 7.

"Powered On Desktop Virtual Machine" means a Desktop Virtual Machine receiving a remote connection from a device or running locally on a device.  

In addition to the above license terms, You may use the Software for up to the total number of Powered On Desktop Virtual Machines for which You have paid the applicable license fees. The VMware vSphere, included in any VMware View edition, is not subject to a vRAM limitation, and your use of vSphere for VMware View is limited to hosting Desktop Virtual Machines and running VMware products which are included in the applicable View edition, or third party connection brokers and desktop management and monitoring tools. Your use of individual features included in a specific View edition is limited to that edition.  The use of individual features interchangeably between View editions is strictly prohibited.

Customers who (i) purchased licenses for vSphere 4.x (or previous versions) prior to September 30, 2011, (ii) use such licensed software to host Desktop Virtual Machines or desktop management and monitoring tools, and (iii) hold current SnS agreements covering such licensed software, may upgrade to vSphere 5.0 while retaining their current licensing metric and associated restrictions and will not be required to adopt the vRAM restricted per-processor licensing model.  Desktop licenses covered by this provision, however, may not be managed by the same instance of Virtual Center which is being used to manage non-Desktop Virtual Machines.
