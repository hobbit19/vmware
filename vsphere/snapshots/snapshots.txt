Snapshots


Delete All
==========
In vSphere the you can use the Snapshot Manager to merge that latest
snapshots back to the base vmdk.

1. Run Snapshot Manager
right-click [machine] > Snapshot > Snapshot Manager...

2. Click Delete All to merge latest snaphost back to vmdk.

Situation:
  Snapshot 1 - 20GB
  Snapshot 2 - 10GB
  Snapshot 3 - 30GB

When you choose "delete all" the following will happen:
1. A helper snapshot is created which holds all changes
2. Snapshot 2 will grow to 40GB at most
3. Snapshot 1 will grow to 60GB at most
4. Snapshot 1 will be committed to the original VMDK
5. The helper is committed to the original
6. All snapshot files are deleted

In other words: Snapshot 3 is merged into Snapshot 2, Snapshot 2 is merged
into Snapshot 1, Snapshot 1 is merged into the original flat.vmdk and
afterwards all snapshot files are deleted.  This means that if you want to
delete all snapshots at once you will need around 70GB of free disk-space in
this particular situation and the size of the helper snapshot.  So think twice
before you press the "delete all" button.

So it comes down to the following:
1. A single snapshot will not grow larger than it's parent disk.
2. The disk files are not deleted until everything is consolidated.
3. A snapshot will grow in 16MB chunks and every time it grows the VMFS
   volume will be locked.

What is a snapshot?
===================
A snapshot preserves the state and data of a virtual machine at a specific
point in time.

The state includes the virtual machine's power state (for example, powered-on,
powered-off, suspended).  The data includes all of the files that make up the
virtual machine.  This includes disks, memory, and other devices, such as
virtual network interface cards. 

A virtual machine provides several operations for creating and managing
snapshots and snapshot chains.  These operations let you create snapshots,
revert to any snapshot in the chain, and remove snapshots. You can create
extensive snapshot trees. 

When creating a snapshot, there are several options you can specify:

       Name: This is used to identify the snapshot.
Description: This is used to describe the snapshot.
     Memory: If the <memory> flag is 1 or true, a dump of the internal state
             of the virtual machine is included in the snapshot.  Memory
             snapshots take longer to create.

    Quiesce: If the <quiesce> flag is 1 or true, and the virtual machine is
             powered on when the snapshot is taken, VMware Tools is used to
             quiesce the file system in the virtual machine.  Quiescing a file
             system is a process of bringing the on-disk data of a physical or
             virtual computer into a state suitable for backups.  This process
             might include such operations as flushing dirty buffers from the
             operating systems in-memory cache to disk, or other higher-level
             application-specific tasks.

       Note: Quiescing indicates pausing or altering the state of running
             processes on a computer, particularly those that might modify
             information stored on disk during a backup, to guarantee a
             consistent and usable backup. 

When a snapshot is created, it is comprised of these files:
  <vm>-<number>.vmdk and <vm>-<number>-delta.vmdk

  A collection of .vmdk and -delta.vmdk files for each virtual disk is
  connected to the virtual machine at the time of the snapshot.  These files
  can be referred to as child disks, redo logs, or delta links.  These child
  disks can later be considered parent disks for future child disks.  From
  the original parent disk, each child constitutes a redo log pointing back
  from the present state of the virtual disk, one step at a time, to the
  original.

  Note: The <number> value may not be consistent across all child disks from
  the same snapshot. The file names are chosen based on filename availability.

  <vm>.vmsd

  The .vmsd file is a database of the virtual machine's snapshot information
  and the primary source of information for the snapshot manager.  The file
  contains line entries which define the relationships between snapshots as
  well as the child disks for each snapshot.

  <vm>Snapshot<number>.vmsn
 
  These files are the memory state at the time of the snapshot. 


How do snapshots work?
======================
Our VMware API allows VMware and third-party products to perform operations
with virtual machines and their snapshots.  This is a list of common
operations that can be performed on virtual machines and snapshots using our
API:

o CreateSnapshot: Creates a new snapshot of a virtual machine.  As a side
  effect, this updates the current snapshot.

o RemoveSnapshot: Removes a snapshot and deletes any associated storage.

o RemoveAllSnapshots: Remove all snapshots associated with a virtual machine.
  If a virtual machine does not have any snapshots, then this operation simply
  returns successfully.

o RevertToSnapshot: Changes the execution state of a virtual machine to the
  state of this snapshot.

  (vSphere 5.0 only) Consolidate: Merges the hierarchy of redo logs.

This is a high-level overview of how to create, remove, or revert snapshot
requests that are processed within the VMware environment:

1. A request to create, remove, or revert a snapshot for a virtual machine
   is sent from the client to the server using the VMware API.

2. The request is forwarded to the VMware ESX host that is currently hosting
   the virtual machine in question.

Note: This only occurs if the original request was sent to a different server,
such as vCenter, which is managing the ESX host.

3. If the snapshot includes the memory option, the ESX host writes the memory
of the virtual machine to disk.

Note: The length of time the ESX host takes to write the memory onto the disk
is relative to the amount of memory the virtual machine is configured to use.

4. If the snapshot includes the quiesce option, the ESX host requests the
guest operating system to quiesce the disks via VMware Tools.

Note: Depending on the guest operating system, the quiescing operation can be
done by the sync driver, the vmsync module, or Microsoft's Volume Shadow Copy
(VSS) service.  For more information on quiescing, see Troubleshooting Volume
Shadow Copy (VSS) quiesce related issues (1007696) for VSS or A virtual
machine can freeze under load when you take quiesced snapshots or use custom 
quiescing scripts (5962168) for the SYNC driver.

5. The ESX host makes the appropriate changes to the virtual machine's
snapshot database (.vmsd file) and the changes are reflected in the snapshot
manager of the virtual machine.

Note: The operation to remove the snapshot entity in the snapshot manager
completes before the changes are made to the child disks. The snapshot
manager does not contain any snapshot entries while the virtual machine
continues to run from the child disk.  For more information, see Committing
snapshots when there are no snapshot entries in the snapshot manager
(1002310).

6. The ESX host calls a function similar to the Virtual Disk API functions
to make changes to the child disks (-delta.vmdk and .vmdk files) and the
disk chain.

Note: During a snapshot removal, if the child disks are large in size, the
operation may take a long time.  This can result in a timeout error message
from either VirtualCenter or the VMware Infrastructure Client.  For more
information about timeout error messages, see vCenter operation times out
with the error: Operation failed since another task is in progress
(1004790). 


The child disk
==============
The child disk, which is created with a snapshot, is a sparse disk.  Sparse
disks employ the copy-on-write (COW) mechanism, in which the virtual disk
contains no data in places, until copied there by a write.  This optimization
saves storage space. The grain is the unit of measure in which the sparse
disk uses the copy-on-write mechanism.  Each grain is a block of sectors 
containing virtual disk data.  The default size is 128 sectors or 64KB.


Child disks and disk usage
==========================
It is important to note these points regarding the space utilization of
child disks:

o If a virtual machine is running off of a snapshot, it is making changes
  to a child or sparse disk.  The more write operations made to this disk,
  the larger it grows.

o The space requirements of the child disk are in addition to the parent
  disk on which it depends.  If a virtual machine has a 10 GB disk with
  a child disk, the space used will be 10 GB + the child disk size.

o Child disks have been known to grow large enough to fill an entire
  datastore.

o The speed at which child disks grow is directly dependent on the amount
  of I/O being done to the disk.

o The size of the child disk has a direct impact on the length of time it
  takes to delete the snapshot associated to the child disk. 

These Knowledge Base articles touch on the topic of child disks and disk
usage:
o No more space for the redo log error when attempting to start a virtual
  machine (1002103)
o Why snapshot removal can stop a virtual machine for long time (1002836)
o Troubleshooting a datastore or VMFS volume that is full or near capacity
  (1003412) 


The disk chain
==============
Generally, when you create a snapshot for the first time, the first child
disk is created from the parent disk.  Successive snapshots generate new
child disks from the last child disk on the chain. The relationship can
change if you have multiple branches in the snapshot chain.
