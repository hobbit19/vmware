Cloning virtual machines in vSphere.

o A VM clone is 100% the same as the source machine you cloned from, the
only thing that changes is the Name given by you on the VC Client, so as
stated, disable the NIC prior to making changes on the VM or you will
have Name / IP conflicts

o Disable the NICs in virtual center (uncheck "connect at power on")  before starting up a 
clone to make sure everything (IP, name, domain, SID) has been properly changed.
