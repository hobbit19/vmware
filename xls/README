  VMWARE NETWORK PORTS Goal: To create a comprehensive list of known
  ports & protocols used for all VMware communications, in order to configure
  firewalls to allow specified traffic.

  V1.0 Current version (First Draft) V1.1 Fill in any blank cells. V1.2
  Improve descriptions in "Functionality" column. Detailed info - How each
  port is used. V2.0 Add a column to indicate which VMware software and
  version # is affected. If this information is available elsewhere, I have
  not found it, please notify me! Thank you Cameron Rake
