P2V Conversion Using VMware vCenter Converter Standalone
by Jeff Staten - September 17, 2013
A bit old...i.e. non-working v5.1
Once you have your VMware private cloud system all set up, you will likely
want to convert any physical machines that you have to virtual machines on
your cloud system.  To help you with this task, VMware created their VMware
vCenter Converter Standalone.  The VMware converter will login to your
Windows or Linux system and copy the entire machine over into a new virtual
machine on a host maintained by your vCenter.

Using StandAlone Converter with SSH Tunnel and keys, no passwords
MadCow1 Apr 21, 2015 8:59 AM
The workaround is this - edit your sshd_config file and set:
  PasswordAuthentication yes
  PermitRootLogin yes
More seriously - Converter does not support SSH key login,
you have to use password.
