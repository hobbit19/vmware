VMware vCenter Converter docs.


VMware vCenter Converter Standalone provides an easy-to-use solution to
automate the process of creating VMware virtual machines from physical
machines (running Windows and Linux), other virtual machine formats, and
third-party image formats.  Through an intuitive wizard-driven interface and a
centralized management console, Converter Standalone can quickly and reliably
convert multiple local and remote physical machines without any disruptions or
downtime.


Functionality
=============
"VMware vCenter Converter (VMware Converter) comes in both Enterprise
($, bundling and entitlement with vCenter Server) and Standalone (free)
versions and is designed primarily for the following tasks:[25]

* Convert a physical machine into a virtual machine; referred to as
  Physical-to-Virtual or P2V.
* Convert a virtual machine of one type into another (V2V)
* Run automated configuration tasks on VMware ESX/ESXi servers."

Boothite Install
================
On boothite using VMware Player 2.5.3 build-185404


V2V
===
Interested in doing a V2V of some of the UAA ITS VMware vCenter virtual
machines.

The "Migration with VMware Converter" section, "Figure 1-1. VMware Converter
Source and Destination Machines" clearly shows virtual machines as source and
VMware Player as the target.  V2v of UAA ITS VMware vCenter virtual machines
to VMplayer should be entirely possible with VMware Converter.
