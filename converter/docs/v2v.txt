Created C:\anc-visual-studio share on spangolite which I shared to axrm.
Use of \\SPANGOLITE\anc-visual-studio for target worked.  However
C: and E; drives on anc-visual-studio are 40GB each.  Not certain
the virtual machine will fit.

Jim Weller advised sdelete to remove 0'd blocks for thin provisioning.

Resized drives in vCenter vConverter to:

    C:   30GB
    E:   20GB
Total:   50GB  <== Should fit on spangolite's spare C: 64.7GB
