Converting a centos 6.4 box for work at GCI Network Services, OSS
for use with VMware.


Tue Jun 16 13:07:22 AKDT 2015
=============================
Per discussion with Jerry Buttitta OSS is running vCenter v5.1.
The VMware hardware will be updated within a month and software to then
follow.  i.e. v5.1 will be updated within the next few months but no time
soon.


Mon Jun 15 14:49:37 AKDT 2015
=============================
1. Install VMware vCenter Converter Standalone 6.0.0 
(VMware-converter-en-6.0.0-2716716.exe) on windows machine of choice.

I installed on rmarcil1 Win 7 pro machine.

When prompted for Setup Type select "Local Installation":

x Local Installation
  Install Converter on this machine.  Use this option to create and manage
  convertion tasks from this local machine only.

  Client-Server Installation (advanced)
  Set up a client-server model for Converter.  Use this option to install
  the server, client or the agent on this machine.

click Next
click Install
...
click Finish


2. Root vs. sudo
By default, VMware vCenter Converter Standalone requires a root
login to the source machine for Linux conversion tasks.  However,
you can also use non-root credentials after enabling the use of
sudo and modifying the source machine to allow the sudo command
to be executed.[1]

NOTE: Could not get converter to work with account in
      /etc/sudoers account on developmen-ray centos 6.5 box
      June 15, 2015.

Since sudo did not work opted to temporarily enable root login:

i. In /etc/ssh/sshd_config set:
   PasswordAuthentication yes    <=== Was already set.
   PermitRootLogin yes           <=== Updated "no" to "yes"

ii. Restart sshd to read new config:
[root@development-ray ssh]# service sshd restart


3. Convert CentOS 6.5 system to VMware.

i. Run the VMware vCenter Converter Standalone Client
on windows to convert the remote centos box:

START > VMware vCenter Converter Standalone Client

ii. At VMware vCenter Converter Standalone
click Convert machine
  
iii. At Source SystemSelect source type: 
x Powered-on machine
  VMware Infrasture virtual machine
  VMware Workstation virtual machine
  Backup image or third-party virtual machine
  Hyper-V server

Specify the powered-on machine
  This local mahine
x A remote machine
  Ip address or name: 192.168.56.48
  User name: root
  Password: ***
  OS Family:   Windows
             x Linux
click Next

iv. At Destinition System
Enter the VMware server (ESXi) server details.

  Source: 192.168.56.48 (centos 6.5 64 bit)    Destination: none
  Destination type: VMware Infrastructure virtual machine
                    Creates a new virtual machine for use on a 
                    VMware Infrastructure product.

  Password:  


Configuration of machine for sudo rather than root access
=========================================================
NOTE: This did not work on GCI Network Services, OSS
development-ray (192.168.56.48) centos 6.5 June 15, 2015.


On development-ray CentOS 6.5 ran visudo to configure sudoers:

[rmarcil@development-ray ~]$ su
Password:
[root@development-ray rmarcil]# visudo   <=== Launches vim by default.

i. Comment out the following entry:
Defaults requiretty

In case the file contains this entry, comment it out.


ii. Add rmarcil account (or whatever account to use) 
for passwordless sudo:
...
##
## Give rmarcil account all privs
## The first prompts for passwords.
## The second does not.
##
##rmarcil    ALL=(ALL)    ALL
rmarcil    ALL=(ALL)    NOPASSWD:ALL
...
ESC:wq     <=== To save and quit.

[root@development-ray rmarcil]# exit
exit
[rmarcil@development-ray ~]$

Test passwordless sudo:
[rmarcil@development-ray ~]$ sudo touch /foo
[rmarcil@development-ray ~]$ ls -l /foo
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jun 15 15:06 /foo
[rmarcil@development-ray ~]$ sudo rm /foo

sudo privs are good.

i. Run the VMware vCenter Converter Standalone Client
on windows to convert the remote centos box:

START > VMware vCenter Converter Standalone Client

ii. click Convert Machine

iii. At Source System popup:

Select source type: 
x Powered-on machine
  VMware Infrasture virtual machine
  VMware Workstation virtual machine
  Backup image or third-party virtual machine
  Hyper-V server

Specify the powered-on machine
  This local mahine
x A remote machine
  Ip address or name: 192.168.56.48
  User name: rmarcil
  Password: ***
  OS Family:   Windows
             x Linux
click Next

Retrieving source machine information...

o Using crypto keys and the plain password failed.
Reset plain text password.

o Now get error:
The user 'rmarcil' does not have root privileges on the source machine.

Could not get rmarcil centos account to work with converter on win 7 pro.


Convert from existing machine
=============================
The Configure machine button always conversion from an existing machine:
o VMware Infrastructure virtual machine
o VMware Workstation or other VMware virtual machine

i. At VMware vCenter Standalone
click Configure machine

ii. At Source system popup
Select the virtual machine type you want to configure

Select source type:
VMware Infrastructure virtual machine
    Configure a virtual machine from VMware vCenter or VMware ESX/ESXi

    Specify server connection information
    Server:    <blank>
    User name: <blank>
    Password:  <blank>

VMware Workstation or other VMware virtual machine
    Configure a virtual machine from VMware Workstation, VMware Player,
    VMware Fusion or other VMware Product.

    Browse for source virtual machine or image
    Virtual machine file: <blank>

Where I can download the VMware Converter linux version?
o There is no Linux Converter, but you can convert live Linux to ESX/VC 
  destination from Windows Converter. HTH
o For CentOS you may need to try the older 5.0.1 Converter since there is a
  regression in 5.1 that prevents it from properly recognizing the kernel
  version of CentOS.
