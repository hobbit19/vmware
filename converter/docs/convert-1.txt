Definately ran out of space working on the e:\ with the www directory. Of course I
was creating the image on the e:\ drive so it might have tried to create an image
of the image. Recursion.

Anyway, will give it another try without the e:\ drive in the list.

=============================
Reran ami-hq-rm windows 2000 workstation conversion and excluded e: drive that
maxed out space. Same parameters otherwise.
