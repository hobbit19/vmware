+++ Tue Aug 30 15:42:31 AKDT 2011 - Install ESXi 5 on USB key with virtual
machine running DSL (Damn Small Linux).  The goal is to use DSL iso as boot
loader for ESXi with a virtual machine all on the stick.

"One other thing - ESX(i) has a 2TB LUN limit.  If you get a RAID controller
and create a 3  TB array, then ESXi won't be able to use it all.  You'll want
to get something that can create multiple arrays on the same disks.  For
example, you would create 2 RAID 5 arrays of 1.5 TB each on the 4 disks.
That way you're under the 2 TB limit but you still use all your drives
efficiently."
Please advise which 4 port SATA RAID card to buy
