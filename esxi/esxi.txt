=============================
I like ESXi for the handful of random non-production systems I use.  I just
don't buy that VM is the right direction for every company as a primary
platform.  Sure, small scale VM has it's benefits, but in a large scale
scenario the overhead and vendor lock in becomes short sighted.  Yes,
eventually with enough VM in your datacenter, you'll save money, but at what
long term expense?  What's that vendor proprietary solution going to do for
you in 10 years when you want to move to the next big thing?  I say build out
your DC using commodity hardware and design your applications and network with
fault tolerance and efficiency in mind.  Need a more efficient footprint?  Try
microservers http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/poweredge-c5125/pd [dell.com]

1. Focus on getting the best bang for your buck with commodity hardware
2. Focus your people on streamlining operations for this model (instead of
   focusing on how to integrate VM with existing models, etc) 
3. Design your applications/architecture around not having some magical 
   single box with a thousand mac addresses that can move around the data
   center on a whim.  Who would be dumb enough to believe in this model?
   Google and Facebook, for starters.
