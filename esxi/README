=============================
Had great get together with current and ex UAA ITS coworkers.  Shena was with
her friend Kari, downtown at Snow City Cafe, helping her with an art display.
Cliff Duncan, ITS Desktop lead, was heading back to work to complete user
migrations and kindly gave me a ride over to the Bear Tooth to meet with the
team.

Met with:

Mark Rice         themarkrice@gmail.com         Now at Alaska USA
Josh P. Ford      jpford2@uaa.alaska.edu        New ITS Systems engineer
Ryan R. Nixon     srnixon@uaa.alaska.edu        Ex-student employee now at
                                                AK state
Kurt Mathews      axkim@uaa.alaska.edu          Ex-student employee now at 
                                                UAA Allied Health Sciences, 
                                                i.e. nursing.
Rachel E Waters   rewaters@uaa.alaska.edu       WebApps lead
Joseph D Watson   jdwatson@dev.uaa.alaska.edu   Systems lead

I actually got to the tooth about 1-1/2 hours after everybody else.  Had to do
a bit of catchup on a pitcher of the Jurassic Stout.  Pretty good but a bit
too viscous or slippier for my total liking. 

            Rachel Waters        Joe Watson
Mark Rice                                         Kurt Mathews
             Josh Ford      Ryan Nixson   myself

Had a good discussion with Ryan Nixon, Curt Mathews, and Mark Rice about
VMware ESXi.  

Discussion points:
o Curt Mathews said that ESXi 5.0 had been released date was August 24, 2011.  
Ryan Nixon said he had just installed ESXi 4.1 in July a month too early.

o When I asked if VMs could be installed on the same phycial system as ESXi 
Mark Rice said that ESXi could be installed on a drive with rest of the drive 
allocated to VMFS for VMs.  Henceforth I think that ESXi could be installed
on a USB drive with a local disk used for VMs.

o Ryan Nixon and Curt Mathews discussed whether an ISO image could be mounted
or referced in VMware's vSphere.  Ryan insisted it was *not* possible.  Curt
thought that it was.

A great group of people that I'd love to go out when it warms up in the
spring.

=============================
Note per discussion with Jim Weller.

o There is some displayed on the ESXi USB boot screen.
o alt-f1 yields unsupported console with root login.
o Updated /etc/init.d to turn on ssh.
o Also supports scp.
o ESXi USB key boot does not mess with any drives.
  i.e. Can try booting on malachite.
o Use VI client to access ESXi.
o VI client, configuration > licensing to enter the license code.
o IP address reported on console at boot.
o Can go to reported IP address to download VI client.
o Alternatively can get VI client from the ESXi 4.0 installer distro.
