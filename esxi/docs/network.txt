The plan is to implement a couple pairs of Netgear GA311 gigabit cards directly, via 
crossover cables, from turchoise (with ESXi) to bornite NAS.  

+++ Need to track down 4x Netgear GA311 gigabit cards and potentially buy a few more.


NETGEAR GA311 10/100/1000Mbps PCI Gigabit Adapter 
with Jumbo Frame support 1 x RJ45 - Retail
price: $24.00 (newegg.com)



Packages
========
Under debian lenny:
  ifenslave - Attach and detach slave interfaces to a bonding device
  ifenslave-2.6 - Attach and detach slave interfaces to a bonding device

  Thinking ifenslave-2.6 installs the bonding driver.

/etc/network/interfaces to look like this:

iface bond0 inet static
  address 10.0.1.5
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  network 10.0.1.0
  gateway 10.0.1.254
  up /sbin/ifenslave bond0 eth0 eth1
  down /sbin/ifenslave -d bond0 eth0 eth1

/etc/modprobe.d/arch/i386:
  alias bond0 bonding
  options bonding mode=5 miimon=100 downdelay=200 updelay=200


Ethernet bonding
================
Ethernet bonding refers to aggregating multiple ethernet channels together to form a 
single channel. This is primarily used for redundancy in ethernet paths or for load 
balancing. This page refers in particular to performing ethernet bonding under Linux, and 
so does not limit itself to discussion of 802.3ad Trunk Aggregation.

Ethernet Bonding Types
======================
The Linux kernel bonding module supports a number of bonding types.

mode=0 (balance-rr)
Round-robin policy: Transmit packets in sequential order from the first available slave 
through the last. This mode provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

mode=1 (active-backup) 
One slave interface is active at any time. If one interface fails, another interface takes 
over the MAC address and becomes the active interface. Provides fault tolerance only. 
Doesn't require special switch support

mode=2 (balance-xor) 
Tranmissions are balanced across the slave interfaces based on ((source MAC) XOR (dest 
MAC)) modula slave count. The same slave is selected for each destination MAC. Provides 
load balancing and fault tolerance.

mode=3 (broadcast)
Transmits everything on all slave interfaces. Provides fault tolerance.

mode=4 (802.3ad) 
This is classic IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic link aggregation. This requires 802.3ad support in 
the switch and driver support for retrieving the speed and duplex of each slave.

mode=5 (balance-tlb) 
Adaptive Transmit Load Balancing. Incoming traffic is received on the active slave only, 
outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current load on each slave. Doesnâ€™t 
require special switch support

mode=6 (balance-alb)
Adaptive Load Balancing - provides both transmit load balancing (TLB) and receive load 
balancing for IPv4 via ARP negotiation. Doesn't require special switch support, but does 
require the ability to change the MAC address of a device while it is open.
