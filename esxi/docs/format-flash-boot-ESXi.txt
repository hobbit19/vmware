Format a USB Flash Drive to Boot the ESXi Installation or Upgrade
=================================================================
You can format a USB flash drive to boot the ESXi installation or upgrade.

The instructions in this procedure assume that the USB flash drive is detected as /dev/sdb.


Prerequisites
=============
o Linux machine
o The ESXi ISO image VMware-VMvisor-Installer-5.0.0-XXXXXX.x86_64.iso, including the 
file isolinux.cfg,where XXXXXX is the build number of the installer ISO image.
o USB flash drive


Procedure
=========
1. Attach the USB flash drive to a Linux machine.
2. Create a partition table.
/sbin/fdisk /dev/sdb
a. Type d to delete partitions until they are all deleted.
b. Type n to create primary partition 1 that extends over the entire disk.
c. Type t to set the type to an appropriate setting for the FAT32 file system, such as c.
d. Type a to set the active flag on partition 1.
e. Type p to print the partition table.

The result should be similar to the following text:

  Disk /dev/sdb: 2004 MB, 2004877312 bytes
  255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 243 cylinders
  Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
     Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
  /dev/sdb1   *           1         243     1951866    c  W95 FAT32 (LBA)

f. Type w to write the partition table and quit.

3. Format the USB flash drive with the Fat32 file system.
  /sbin/mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n USB /dev/sdb1

4. Run the following commands.
  /path_to_syslinux-3.82_directory/syslinux-3.82/bin/syslinux /dev/sdb1
  cat /path_to_syslinux-3.82_directory/syslinux-3.82/usr/share/syslinux/mbr.bin > /dev/sdb1

5. Mount the USB flash drive.
  mount /dev/sdb1 /usbdisk

6. Mount the ESXi installer ISO image.
  mount -o loop VMware-VMvisor-Installer-5.0.0-XXXXXX.x86_64.iso /esxi_cdrom

7. Copy the contents of the ISO image to /usbdisk.
  cp -r esxi_cdrom/* /usbdisk

8. Rename the isolinux.cfg file to syslinx.cfg.
  mv /usbdisk/isolinux.cfg /usbdisk/syslinux.cfg

9. Unmount the USB flash drive.
  umount /usbdisk

10. Unmount the installer ISO image.
  umount /esxi_cdrom

The USB flash drive can now boot the ESXi installer.
