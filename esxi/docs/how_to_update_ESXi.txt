ESXi patches and updates can be downloaded from here.

The Quick & Easy way to Install the patches are..

If VMware Infrastructure Update(VIU) is not installed, reinstall 
VMware Infrastructure Client and select (VIU) during the install. 
Its part of that.

Shutdown all the VM's. The Update will reboot the ESXi host

1. Connect the VI Client to the host that needs to be updated.
2. Choose Start > Programs > VMware > VMware Infrastructure Update. 
(this is installed during the VI client install for ESXi)
3. On the Hosts tab, select the ESXi hosts to check for updates.
4. On the Updates tab, click Check Now.
5. Install the Update. This will download the Update.
6. Once the update is downloaded, will prompt for authentication for 
your ESXi host and install the update.
7. From VI Client, reboot the ESXi host

Best and shortest discussion that covers a relatively confusing 
subject to have to google.
