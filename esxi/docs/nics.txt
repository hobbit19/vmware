ESXi compatible nics.

For the virtualization server buildup ideally want 6 nics.
Unfortunately I think two 4-port or 4-port and 2-port PCIe 
Intel nics is the way to go.  Show me the dollars.

Best compatible PCIe Intel nic?

Intel E1G44HT  - quad port, PCIe 2.0, 82580 chipset, 5GT/s lane x4 lane
Intel E1G44ET2 - quad port, PCIe 2.0, 82576 chipset, 2.5 GT/s Lane x 4 Lane
Intel E1G42ET  - dual port, PCIe 2.0, 82576 chipset, 2.5 GT/s Lane x 4 Lane
  "This card does work with ESXi 5 using out of the box drivers." (newegg - Feb 8, 2012)

o Intel 82576 Gigabit Ethernet Controller
o Low-profile
o iSCSI remote boot support
o Compatible with x4, x8, and x16 standard and low-profile PCI Express* slots
o Virtual Machine Device Queues (VMDQ)

Intel Ethernet Server Adapter I350-T2 <==
  2-port, PCIe v2.0 (5.0GT/s), 5 GT/s, x4 Lane, Intel I350, VMDQ, $128 - $136
 
Intel Ethernet Server Adapter I350-T4 <==
  4-port, PCIe v2.0 (5.0GT/s), 5 GT/s, x4 Lane, Intel I350, VMDQ, $299 - $318

Intel Ethernet Server Adapter I340-T2
  2-port, PCIe v2.0 (5.0GT/s), 5 GT/s, x4 Lane, Intel 82580, VMDQ, n/a (discontinued ???)

Intel Ethernet Server Adapter I340-T4
  4-port, PCIe v2.0 (5.0GT/s), 5 GT/s, x4 Lane. Intel 82580, VMDQ, $247 - $260


Does ESXi 5 provide great compatibility for multiple NIC?
=========================================================
Of course, always add NIC's ESX/ESXi.  Minimum recommended is 4, and 6 in case you 
have iSCSI based storage.

NIC0 & NIC1 - vMotion & Management network -ensure only is active and other is stand by.
NIC2 & NIC3 - Virtual Machines
NIC4 & NIC5 - iSCSI (If you have)

Also ensure NIC01 goes to Phy Switch01 and NIC0 goes to Phy Switch02, this way you can 
achieved redudancy even at switch level

Same for other nic as well. 

Hope it helps
