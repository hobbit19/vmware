vSphere ESXi on a USB memory stick
==================================

The procedure has not changed much since ESXi 3.5 but I thought I would 
document it anyway. A lot of people seem to end up here by googling 
"USB ESXi vSphere".

Here you go:
   1. First get the following tools: 7-Zip(Free), WinImage(Demo)
   2. Download the ESXi ISO (VMware-VMvisor-Installer-4.0.0-164009.x86_64.iso)
   3. Open the ISO with 7-Zip
   4. Open "image.tgz" with 7-Zip
   5. Browse to "image.tgz.temptar\usr\lib\vmware\installer\VMware-VMvisor-big-164009-x86_64.dd.bz2\"
   6. Extract "VMware-VMvisor-big-164009-x86_64.dd"
   7. Open WinImage and go to Disk, click on "Restore Virtual Harddisk Image 
on physical drive"
   8. Select a physical drive
   9. Select "VMware-VMvisor-big-164009-x86_64.dd"
  10. And click "yes" to write the DD image to the USB Disk

Done! Now, let's see if I can get my old Dell GX620 running with vSphere ESXi


Need 1GB USB stick.

Also the same as before, you can use dd under linux/cygwin
  dd if=VMware-VMvisor-big-164009-x86_64.dd of=device (/dev/sdX) bs=1M

Hi Duncan, I have successfully used your method to deploy ESXi4 on USB keys. The only way to 
run VMs is to attached a data store via iSCSI, NFS or local drives. Personally I want to use 
the USB key itself to store my VMs but could not find out a way... Any idea ?

--------------

Actually, the method has changed considerably since ESX 3.5. In fact, the CD-ROM installer 
will find your USB flash drive and install directly to it without resorting to imaging or 
dd.

The process - from CD-boot to initial start-up â€“ is about 14 minutes long, depending on 
CD-ROM speed and flash speed.
