Installation of ESXi on usb key.


The plan is to install ESXi 5 on a usb key for maximum
reliability.  The trick is then accessing local disks
and nas for machines.

I think installation of ESXi 5 to usb key is easily
accomplished via the ESXi 5 bootable install cdrom.

The next is configuration of local disk and nas for
vm access.  Looks like this can be  accomplished using
RDM (Raw Device Mapping) or VMFS (Virtual Machine File
System) formatted disk.

"As Chopper said, you can use RDM for direct access to
the hardware, however, it may be more  beneficial to
format the SAS drive as a VMFS, create a vmdk file on
it, and map that as an additional virtual disk.  This
way you'll take advantage of the encapsulation, making
it easy to move, clone, snapshot, backup, etc."[1]

Reads like adaptec controllers are supported:
  "Basic SCSI controllers. Adaptec Ultra-160 or Ultra-320,
  LSI Logic Fusion-MPT, or most NCR/Symbios SCSI."[2]

Do understand that your drive controller is a single point
of failure.  ESXi on a flash drive is a good choice.  There
is very little writing to the flash drive.  I don't think
the server manufacturers would be selling servers with ESXi
in flash if it was a big problem.  The reason we have been
using RAID for storage is because we know our rotating
media WILL fail.[3]
