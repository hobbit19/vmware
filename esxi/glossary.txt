RDM  - Raw Device Mapping
       "As Chopper said, you can use RDM for direct access to the hardware, however, it may be
       more beneficial to format the SAS drive as a VMFS, create a vmdk file on it, and map that
       as an additional virtual disk.  This way you'll take advantage of the encapsulation, making
       it easy to move, clone, snapshot, backup, etc."
